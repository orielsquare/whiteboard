# Font Animator — project guide

A suite for producing **styled videos of live numeracy/maths solutions** (eventual export: MP4).
The core idea: turn a font into reusable **per-character handwriting animations** (each glyph drawn
as natural pen strokes), then **compose those into slides** to build an animated text video.

Built with **Vite + React + TypeScript**. Runs entirely in the browser; a small Vite dev-server
middleware persists data to disk. Node 20 and ffmpeg are available locally (ffmpeg only matters for
the future MP4 export).

> design for the next phases (the Video editor, VP2–VP5).

## Run / build / verify

```bash
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173  (Vite; serves /api/fonts + /api/projects)
npm run build      # tsc + vite build
node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit   # typecheck (do this after every change set)
```

- **npm install gotcha:** the global npm cache (`~/.npm`) has root-owned files and fails with
  `EACCES`. Use a project-local cache: `npm install --cache ./.npm-cache --no-audit --no-fund`.
- **Preview/verification env caveats** (the Claude preview tool, not real browsers): it throttles
  `requestAnimationFrame`, `canvas.getImageData` reads back **transparent**, and synthetic canvas
  clicks / dnd-kit drags often don't register. So **verify via `preview_screenshot` + DOM/state
  reads, not pixel reads**; drive animations by **scrubbing to a fixed time** (deterministic), and
  treat stale `?t=<old-hash>` console errors as buffered HMR noise (they don't clear on reload).
  The app itself works fine in a normal browser.

## Architecture principles

- **One pure data pipeline, framework-free.** All extraction, animation, rendering, layout, and
  project logic lives in `src/lib/` with **no React/DOM-store imports**, so the same code drives the
  live preview *and* a future headless Node+ffmpeg exporter. React lives only in `src/app/`.
- **Geometry immutable; intent is flags.** Extracted glyph centerlines are never mutated; editorial
  intent (order, reversed direction, splits/merges, timing, pauses) is applied at `evaluate()`/render
  time. Editing is lossless.
- **Pure seams for export:** `evaluate(glyph, tMs)` (single glyph) and `renderProject(ctx, project,
  tMs, w, h)` (video) are time-as-argument pure functions → preview and headless export share them.
- **Video coordinates are normalized to canvas width** (aspect/resolution-independent); px is derived
  per-frame as `value × canvasW`.
- **Rendering = a variable-width "ribbon"** whose cross-section is orthogonal to the stroke centerline
  (natural moving pen-front), textured by chalk/ink/marker brushes (deterministic seeded grain).

                ordered glyph list (listFontChars). Font side keeps the loader + sub-tabs
                (Glyphs grid/Stroke extraction/Editor/Animation preview). Extraction params are PER GLYPH

## Data, stores, persistence

- **`useEditorStore`** (zundo): the per-font `FontManifest` (glyph stroke sections + per-section
  timing). `updateGlyph`/`markReviewed`/`setGlyphParams` set `edited:true`/bump `updatedAt`;
  `ensureGlyphDerived(extractor,char)` seeds-or-re-derives a glyph using ITS OWN stored `extractionParams`
  (or DEFAULT_PARAMS); skips `edited` ones; compares `derivedSig`. `commitDerivedGlyph` pauses history AND
  uses `setGlyphSilent` (no `updatedAt` bump) so background auto-derivations are neither undoable nor mark
  the manifest dirty. `dirty = manifest.updatedAt !== lastSavedAt`; `markSaved()`/load-from-disk clear it
  (drives the greyed Save button). Saved to `fonts/<hash>/manifest.json` (+ `font.ttf`).
- **`useVideoStore`** (zundo, separate history): the `VideoProject` (slides). Document state tracked;
  selection/view transient (`partialize`). Saved to `projects/<id>.json`. `ensureProjectGlyphsDerived`
  derives every char used in the project.
- **Brush is an applied style, NOT glyph data** — it's transient app state, the picker lives in the
  Animation tab; the video project carries its own global `brush`. Never store brush in the font manifest.

## Two tools, top-level Font/Video switch (App.tsx)

**Font tool** — keeps the font loader + a font-wide action bar (Undo/Redo/**Save font** [greyed until the
manifest is dirty]/Reload, shared by every sub-tab) prominent at the top; four sub-tabs:
1. **Glyphs** (landing) — `GlyphGridView`: every Unicode glyph in a vertically-scrolling grid (~18pt cells);
   a global **Font/Strokes** toggle flips all cells between the font outline and the extracted pen-strokes
   (strokes derived lazily as cells scroll into view); click a cell to open that glyph at its last-visited
   view (Stroke extraction by default, Editor if you've been there).
2. **Stroke extraction** — read-only debug overlay of the automatic extraction; tune the **per-glyph**
   extraction params (live; stored on the glyph, persisted with the font). View toggles stay global.
3. **Editor** — pick a glyph; reorder/flip/split/merge stroke sections (drag + buttons); per-section
   timing; brush-less neutral-pen play preview; Reset glyph re-derives from the glyph's stored params.
4. **Animation preview** — animate holding text with the chosen brush; reflects per-glyph edits.

Stroke extraction and Editor share a `CharStepper` (the Character/Glyph input + ‹ › arrows that browse the
font's glyph list).

**Video tool** — slide-based animated-text editor; no font loader (font is a per-text formatting option
from all SAVED fonts). Its own view switch (in `VideoView`), in order:
**Layout** (drag/select/add textboxes; **double-click a box to edit its text in place** via `TextBoxOverlay`;
the single horizontal `FormatBar` styles the selection / box / new-box defaults; **Cmd/Ctrl-C/X/V** copy/cut/
paste the selected textbox across slides via a transient `clipboardBox` — deferring to the browser while a
text field/overlay is focused), **Order** (animation order +
per-slide Play), **VTT** (WebVTT script + ElevenLabs voice panel/TTS), **Timeline** (real-time voiceover
timeline: sections/zoom/leader-line drag), **▶ Play** (project play-all + synced voiceover).
See HANDOVER.md for the voiceover feature notes.

**Video formatting** — one `FormatBar` above the canvas: per-run **font** (saved-fonts dropdown), size,
colour, underline, **kerning** (`TextRun.letterSpacing`), plus per-box **line-height** (`lineHeightScale`)
and align, plus the project **pen type** (chalk/ink/marker `brush.style`). Colour with a selection is the
run colour; with nothing selected it's the global `brush.color`. (The old `.video-top` brush style/colour
controls were removed — formatting lives only in the bar.) It syncs to the selection (mixed → indeterminate, via `runs.ts` `selectionStyle`) and applies via
`applyTextStyle`; with nothing selected it edits `ProjectDefaults`. **Named styles** (`VideoProject.namedStyles`,
per-project) save the selection's non-mixed fields as a reusable `StylePatch` and apply to a selection.
Per-run **fonts** resolve through a `FontSet` (`layout.ts`/`render.ts`); the Video tool builds it from
`useFontRegistry` + the live editor font; MP4 export sends `fontsById` so preview == export.

**Shared across tabs** (in App): `selectedChar`, `brush`, and a single `GlyphExtractor` (one Web Worker per
font). Extraction params live PER GLYPH in the manifest (`GlyphAnimation.extractionParams`); the active
glyph is re-derived centrally when its stored params change (App watches the selected glyph's params
signature), gated on `manifest.metadata.fontId === font.hash`. `glyphParams(glyph)` returns the glyph's
params or `DEFAULT_PARAMS`.

## Conventions

- Render loops: a single `requestAnimationFrame` reading **refs** (not React state per frame); time
  in a `tRef`; transport (play/pause/scrub/speed/loop) like `PreviewView`.
- Reordering/lists: **dnd-kit** (`DndContext`+`SortableContext`+`useSortable`+`arrayMove`,
  `PointerSensor` distance 4), with `↑/↓` buttons as a verified fallback.
- Pure edit helpers return new objects (immutable); store actions are thin `set` wrappers.
- New dev-server routes: add a plugin in `vite.config.ts` mirroring `fontStorePlugin` and a fetch
  client mirroring `FontStore.ts`.

## Status

Font tooling (load → extract → edit → animate → save) is complete. The **Video editor (VP1–VP5) is
complete**: slides (add/copy/delete/drag-reorder + save/load), the **Layout** view (drag/select/add
textboxes; **direct on-canvas text editing** via `TextBoxOverlay` + the one horizontal `FormatBar`),
**inline rich text** (per-selection font/size/colour/underline/kerning via `runs.ts`; line-height + align
per box; **named styles** in `VideoProject.namedStyles`; per-run multi-font via `FontSet`), the
**Order** view (per-box animation order + delays + per-slide Play), **Play** (project-level play-all
with an All/Selected scope for single-slide or subset playback), per-slide **background colour**,
human-style **underlines** (drawn after the word), a transport **preview speed** (×0.25–12, transient —
it scales only the preview clock + voiceover `<audio>` rate in `usePlaybackEngine`; the timeline model
and the MP4 always run real time; `VideoProject.playbackRate` is a legacy field nothing reads), and
per-**textbox brush** overrides (`TextBox.brush`, falling back to the project brush; a run's colour
still wins). **MP4 export** is done: the pure render seam
(`src/lib/project/` `buildRenderContext` + `renderProject`/`renderSlide`/`projectDurationMs`, with
`tools/{layout,runs,timing,vtt}.test.mjs` covering the pure engines) is driven headlessly by
`tools/videoExport.mjs` (`@napi-rs/canvas` → ffmpeg) behind `POST /api/export` and a toolbar button.
Voiceover audio is muxed in a second ffmpeg pass (silent video → mix each cue's clip at its absolute
`startMs` via `adelay`/`amix`/`apad` + `-shortest`); skipped when slide-scoped, falls back to silent on
failure.

**Voiceover — complete** (a project-wide WebVTT track synced to the animation; see `HANDOVER.md` →
"Voiceover feature" for decisions + design). **P1–P4 done & verified:** the data model
(`VideoProject.voiceover: VoiceoverCue[]`, absolute-time cues, no box/slide link), the pure `vtt.ts`
engine, the editable **VTT** sub-view + read-only slide extract, **TTS** (**ElevenLabs** — `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
env key; the VTT Voice panel picks an account voice [accent comes from the voice], a model, and per-model
steering [v3 = free-text direction, else stability/style/speed sliders] — → ffmpeg `.m4a` via `/api/tts`,
voices listed + free preview samples via `/api/voices`, each clip storing the settings it was made with
[shown as a reuse-settings chip], **text-only** stale shading, and clock-synced `<audio>` playback), the
full-width **Timeline**
view (`TimelineView.tsx` — real-time-scaled DOM track: slide sections + numbered writing sub-bars + hold
+ bleeding transition overlays + ruler + floating thumbnails; **mouse-wheel zoom** [cursor-anchored] +
**Space/Shift+wheel** horizontal scroll; per-cue **audio-length bars** [yellow = ready, amber/hatched =
stale]; each element bar is its **envelope with a draggable animation block** — slide the block, stretch
its edges, or drag the envelope's right edge to resize it [deferred-write, one undo per gesture; pure math
shared with the Inspector's `EnvelopeBar` via `envelopeEdit.ts`; the **global "scale with envelope"**
toggle — `videoStore.scaleWithEnvelope`, mirrored in both views — picks whether the contents scale or the
animation keeps its absolute length (unscaled resizes grow/consume END padding first, then start padding,
then floor at the block — it never compresses); an envelope-length change also **shifts cues in the same
write** (`resizeElementTiming` + `videoEdit.shiftCuesFrom`) per the toolbar's **"lock audio to
element/slides" radios** (`videoStore.audioLock`): 'slides' (default) shifts only cues at/after the next
slide (audio over the element's own slide stays put); 'element' shifts from the element's envelope end, so
audio follows the elements the resize pushes within its slide too]), and draggable voiceover **leader lines** (**deferred-write**: pointermove moves a local
transform, the cue model is written once on release ≡ one undo, so dragging never re-lays-out the timeline
mid-gesture; double-click to add; **multi-select** cues by marquee-dragging empty band space or
shift/⌘-clicking — a selection drags together as ONE `translateCues` write). Voiceover audio is **muxed into the MP4 export** (a second ffmpeg pass
places each cue's clip at its absolute `startMs`), and the exported-video preview shows **optional
captions** built from the voiceover (a snapshot WebVTT `<track>`, toggleable). Closing transitions are
fade / rubout / scroll-up·down·left·right, and the transport's **preview speed** runs ×0.25–12. **Next — "later"
items:** image/photo backgrounds, batch "extract all glyphs", mid-stroke pause UI, scope MP4 export to
the play selection.
